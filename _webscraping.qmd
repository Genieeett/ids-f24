## Web Scraping

This section was written by Melanie Desroches, a senior majoring in statistics and minoring in computer science.
The goal of this section is to introduce web-scraping so that it can be utilized for data science. This will 
include what web-scraping is, how to web-scrape with Python using examples, and how to web-scrape ethically.

### What is Web-Scraping
As data scientists, we often want to collect data from a variety of sources. In the age of the internet, a lot 
of the data we may want to collect is available on a website. However, this data is often times not available 
in an easily downloadable format. This is where web-scraping becomes valuable. Web-scraping is an automated 
process used to gather data from websites. This allows us to access and collect large amounts of data directly 
from web pages if the information is not avalible for download.
